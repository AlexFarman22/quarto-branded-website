## <span style="color: #8C1515;">About</span>

I am a student at Stanford University currently in my senior year of undergraduate studies. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics with honors, with interests focused in Industrial Organization, Capital Markets and Development Economics. I am also pursuing a concurrent Master of Science degree in Statistics. I intend to confer both degrees simultaneously in May 2026.

## <span style="color: #8C1515;">Professional Interests</span>

I am presently exploring my professional fit as a finance professional working to support companies in various stages of their capital needs. I have interned at Helios Investment Parnters, a private equity investment firm focused on businesses in emerging African markets, and most recently at Sageview Capital, a growth equity investment firm focused on software and tech-enabled services businesses in the United States and Canada. I'm grateful for all that I have learned and prioritize diverse experiences as I continue to discover my fit in the professional world.

## <span style="color: #8C1515;">Background / Personal Interests</span>

I was born in New York City, to Iranian and French-American parents, although we soon moved to London, where I lived until 18. I'm immensely grateful for the cross-cultural exposure I gained in my childhood. Living in new environments and learning from the lived experiences of friends and mentors from backgrounds different to my own is a common thread in my personal, academic and professional lives. I'm immensely grateful for my new community in the Bay Area and for all that I've learned through engaging in a full social and academic life at Stanford. When I'm not studying or with my friends, I can be found: in a piano practice room at the music department, hiking and skiing, riding my motorcycle and reading about / watching all different types of world cinema.
